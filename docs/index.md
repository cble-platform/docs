## Project Inspiration

This project was proposed as an Independent Study at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu) as a part of my
(Bradley Harker) Cybersecurity MS degree program in the Fall 2023 semester. The original project proposal is here:

??? abstract "Independent Study Proposal"

    _The goal of this independent study is to develop a fully-automated self-service virtual lab environment
    that aims to be both scalable and flexible to fit any form of deployment as well as learn about requirements
    engineering, project planning, and project design throughout the process. The platform will be provider
    agnostic, allowing it to conform to any public or private cloud provider to host the underlying virtual lab
    machines. It will support both legacy and modern work-flows for lab development, speeding up the process
    of evolving course content. The intention is to expand this into production to offer a replacement for the
    current Remote Laboratory Emulation System (RLES) and integrate in the Computing
    Security/Cybersecurity future curriculum. The project will include proofing the ease of migration by
    migrating existing course lab content to the new platform. The requirements engineering will be performed
    by interviewing multiple stakeholders involved in the project such as: RIT Faculty (ITS/Teaching Staff),
    Students, and External Academic Institution Faculty. Doing this will help general the project requirements
    needed to satisfy all potential stakeholders in the project. Project design will be performed surrounding the
    requirements identified. A report of this process will be written and presented to describe both the findings
    of the interviews and the resulting design extrapolated from the findings. No current course in the CSEC
    curriculum offers this kind of opportunity to develop a product (the platform) in collaboration with a client
    (RIT) and teach the project design and project management progress._

The project was then continued as a Capstone Project at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu) as a part of
my (Bradley Harker) Cybersecurity MS degree program in the Spring 2024 semester. The paper abstract is here:
